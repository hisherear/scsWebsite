        <h2>Why SCS?</h2>
        <p>Seoul Christian School is focused on providing an academically rigorous, biblically-focused curriculum that covers a wide range of subjects in order to prepare your child for college, the workplace, and their career.</p>
        <p>We are especially interested in teaching students to be competent in English so that they have a wider range of academic and employment opportunities available to them when they graduate. We offer an ESL program as well as a full English curriculum
          for each student.</p>
        <p>Our one-to-one program pairs each student with a laptop, allowing us to teach them to effectively use technology in their education. This helps to equip them both for a stronger education and for careers in a networked world.</p>

        <h2>After SCS?</h2>
        <p>Our students graduate with a solid academic foundation which they can build on at a number of universities around the world. Our faculty work with the students to assist them in applying to schools and are more than happy to provide letters of
          recommendation.</p>
        <p>90% of Seoul Christian School graduates successfully apply for and enter college immediately after graduation, and the remaining 10% enter college after taking a gap year. We have graduates studying and working in Korea, the United States, Japan,
          and the United Kingdom.</p>
        <p>We also are developing a tracked program for students who plan to attend Korean colleges or universities that will allow them to take their exams by the time they graduate, instead of needing to take an additional year for study.</p>

      <h2>Student Testimonial: Cassie Cho</h2>
      <p>I think SCS prepared me a lot to become a better Christian, and to study abroad. Before I come to this school, I thought I was a good Christian, but truely, I wasn't. By taking Bible classes and devotion times, I had a chance to think about my life
        as a Christian. So I accepted Jesus as my savior, and now I became a better Christian, even though I still do wrong things. Also, I am going to England and study there. If I did not come to SCS, I would not have thought of going to the UK. Since
        this school is an American school in Korea, I learned how speak English. Before I come to SCS, I did not know how to speak English, but because I studied in English in here, I learned a lot of English words. Therefore, now I have a confidence
        in me that I can communicate with English people, and study in English.</p>
