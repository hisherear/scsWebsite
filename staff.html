Through God's guidance and provision I was able to enter Bob Jones University as a freshman three years later and earn my degree in Composite Social Studies Education. God further blessed me by allowing me the opportunity to serve Him here at Seoul Christian School. I look forward to serving God in this capacity and especially with the students he blesses me with. My life verse is Proverbs 3:5-6, Trust in The Lord with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and he will direct your path.

                        <p>While in upper elementary school, the Lord helped me to understand that in order to become a Christian I needed to ask Jesus to save me from my sins. Later as an adult, the Lord provided for me to be educated at Bob Jones University and to receive two degrees: BA in Christian Missions and a M.Ed. in Elementary Education. After graduating, He  opened the doors for me to teach in Guam, China, States, and now, South Korea. This is my 16th year teaching, and as an educator it is my desire to partner together with parents to help students to grow academically, socially, emotionally, and most importantly, spiritually.</p>
