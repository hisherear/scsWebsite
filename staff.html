                        <p>While in upper elementary school, the Lord helped me to understand that in order to become a Christian I needed to ask Jesus to save me from my sins. The Lord provided for me to be educated at Bob Jones University and to receive two degrees: BA in Christian Missions and a M.Ed. in Elementary Education. After graduating, He opened the doors for me to teach in Guam, China, the United States, and now, South Korea. This is my 16<sup>th</sup> year teaching, and as an educator it is my desire to partner together with parents to help students to grow academically, socially, emotionally, and most importantly, spiritually.</p>
