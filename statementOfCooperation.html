    <small>Statement of Cooperation</small>
  </h1>
  <ol>
    <li>In making application for my child, it is my desire to have him complete the
      <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write(new Date().getFullYear() - 1 + "-" + new Date().getFullYear());
      </script> school year. It is also my understanding that the policy of the school is to make no refunds on registration fees.</li>
    <li>I give permission for my child to take part in school activities, including sports and school sponsored trips</li>
    <li>We agree that if our child should become involved in any difficulty with other children in the school or with any school personnel, or if we are concerned with and do not agree with the actions, policies or decisions of a teacher or administrator
      whether it stems from the classroom, an extracurricular event, or discipline, we will not complain to or discuss these things with other parents or students; but with a prayerful Christian spirit will register only necessary complaints or concerns
      with the appropriate school personnel involved in the issue. The Biblical principle being followed in this procedure is found in Matthew 18: 15-17.</li>
    <li>We are in agreement with the rules and regulations set forth by the school, and we shall endeavor to support and uphold the principles, practices, and policies of the school in every way.</li>
    <li>We understand that the school reserves the right to dismiss any student who does not cooperate with the educational process, and that all students are accepted on a probationary basis.</li>
    <li>We agree that the administration has full responsibility for placing my child in the proper grade. His acceptance is left totally to the discretion of the administration and is no guarantee of readmission in subsequent years.</li>
    <li>We agree that this application fee covers one school year only.</li>
    <li>We agree that the first tuition payment must be paid before the student(s) enter(s) school.</li>
    <li>We agree to pay our financial obligation to the school on or before the first school day of the month.</li>
    <li>We understand that if payments are not received by the 5th of the month, a 5% late charge will be assessed to our account.</li>
    <li>We understand that if our tuition obligation is one month behind and we have not made financial arrangements with the school, our children will not be allowed to attend school until such payments or financial arrangements can be made. Absence as a
      result of the above named reasons will be considered as unexcused.</li>
    <li>We also understand that if for any reason our child(ren) is/are withdrawn during the school year, the current month&#39;s charges are due and will not be refunded.</li>
    <li>It will be the purpose of SCS to not openly cooperate with the ecumenical or charismatic movements and it is our desire that parents and students of SCS not propagate doctrines or positions incompatible with those of our school while a part of the
      school environment. It should also be understood, that although we plan to use the New King James translation as our primary translation, we are not a part of the &quot;King James only‚Äù movement.</li>
    <li>To be consistent with the goal of assisting parents in training their children according to biblical precepts, only those families and students who truly desire a Christ-centered education will be enrolled in the secondary. We ask that parents be
      in agreement with the basic philosophy of SCS and the students in grades 6 ~12 must themselves desire to attend SCS because of its dedication to honor Christ and promote biblical principles.</li>
    <li>We understand that scripture clearly teaches in I Cor. 6:1-8 that believers are not to arbitrate before unbelievers, rather difficulties should be resolved and cared for before believers. Parties signing this agreement should therefore understand
      that any differences which may arise between them and any school official should not be taken before a court of law.</li>
